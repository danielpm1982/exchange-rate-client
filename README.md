[**Description of this repository**]<br>
This is a sample app created with Node.js, npm, JavaScript ES6+, TypeScript and Electron.js.<br>
The objective of this project is simply to demonstrate how to use these technologies. This app basically accesses a REST exchange rate API, available at https://www.exchangerate-api.com, retrieves the result, with the conversion rates of the selected currency to other currencies, and shows it to the user.<br>
It is a multi-platform desktop app that runs natively on Linux, Windows or iOS, according to the respective distro, and has the GUI components rendered by Electron from the html, css and .js files (compiled from the .ts files).<br>
For running the sources of this app from VSCode you gotta have Node.js and npm installed globally at your OS. After cloning this project, just go the directory and run npm install, to install the dependency modules at the project; npm run tsc-compilate-project (or tsc-compilate-project-win if on Windows), to compile the .ts files to .js files; and npm start (to start the app).<br>
For running an executable build, compiled to your OS, on the other hand, you have to create the build and the executable file yourself, by running one of the three commands below (according to your system):<br>
npm run package-linux<br>
npm run package-win<br>
npm run package-mac<br>
.<br>
Later, go to the folder of the distro and run the executable file - e.g.: ./exchange-rate-client-v1.0.0 if on Linux or clicking twice on the .exe file if on Windows.

This repository is a single-project repo with Git version control.

Some of my repositories are for backup only, each of them being a collection of tens of projects inside one same repo (with no individual version control for each project), and others are single-project repositores (with effective version control for that single project). As a distinction between them, the backup repos are named in uppercase with underscores (e.g. SPRING3) while the single-project ones are named in lowercase with dashes (e.g. springboot2-ac-di).
